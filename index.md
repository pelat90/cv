As a member of the PTR team (Real Time Platform), I had to do different tasks, 
like optimize and migrate services which were deployed on Websphere and Weblogic to Openshift. 
My job was to improve those services along the team and lower the response time of them,

Those services received a good amount of requests.

Working with more people with different roles, but that also were/are part 
of an application life cycle, have made communication something crucial on a daily basis. 
Teamwork is one of the most important things for me and this is 
why I like to contribute to create a healthy and pleasant work environment.

__Organisational skills__
Being part of projects with several applications, have helped me to develop my 
organisational capabilities, teaching me how to manage time and tasks when the work load is high.
Also being the main developer of a feature/service, also helped me to keep 
everything under control and well documented.
