__Altia, Alicante (Spain)__

As a member of the PTR team (Real Time Platform), I had to do different tasks,

My job was to improve those services along the team and lower the response time of them, 
since they needed the information as updated as possible, with the minimum latency possible. 
Those services received a good amount of requests.
